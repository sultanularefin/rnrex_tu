// 1. state
// 2. action
// The first time, it will take the initial state of our application, and then we pass whatever argument,

// it takes that argument and operates based on the case execution.

// The second argument is action, which consists of type and payload.

// The payload is the place name, we have entered inside the text box.

// So it adds the text boxâ€™s value inside places array.

// Remeber here; we have returned a new state and not existing state. So we have modified the state in the pure manner and not existing state.
